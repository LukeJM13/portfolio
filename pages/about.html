    <h2 class="nameTitle">- Education -</h2>
    <h3>The University of Leicester</h3>
    <div class="explainer">
        <p id="geoPara">I went to study Geology at the University of Leicester in 2016, graduating with a 2:1 grade in 2019. During my time at university 
            and studying Geology in general, I've been on lots of fieldtrips to some amazing places; including Cyprus, Spain, the 
             Highlands of Scotland and Snowdonia in Wales. I learnt a lot and have taken away many skills from university that I use in day to day life and at work.</p>

    <h2 class="nameTitle">- Career Highlights -</h2>
    <h3>Bulb Energy</h3>
    <div class="explainer">
        <p id="bulbPara">After university, I went to work for Bulb Energy in London. It was great to be a part of a fast-paced start-up during a period of growth, as 
            there were always new challenges to overcome and each day was different to the last. While working at Bulb, I spent time in customer experience, the 
            operations team and also their social media team, which allowed me to pick up lots of new skills and work with lots of great people.</p>

    <h3>The Electric Car Scheme</h3>
    <div class="explainer">
        <p id="electricPara">In 2022, I joined the team at the Electric Car Scheme, as a Business Development Executive. I got the chance to speak to lots of 
            interesting people and talk to them about our product; looking to see if it would be a good fit for their business. It was really rewarding to be a part of
        a company which was at such an early stage of growth, as I felt very valued. It was during my time at the company that I decided I wanted to make a change and explore a career in software.</p>
